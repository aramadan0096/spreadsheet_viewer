"Text above or left of the body.

Use “{{Style [Letter Style Name]}}” to change the letter style to [Letter Style Name] and just “{{Style}}” to reset it. Example: “Copyright 2023 {{Style Name}}Thomas Cash”","Text, images, or videos between the most recent head and tail. Depending on the content style, each table row is a new grid cell, flow cell, or paragraph.

“{{Style …}}” works like in the @Head.

Use “{{Blank}}” for an empty cell.

Use “{{Pic [Filename]}}” to insert a picture or “{{Video [Filename]}}” to insert a video or image sequence from the project folder. These can then be configured in the styling window. You may omit the file extension, or append a qualifier to separately configure multiple appearances of the same file. Examples: “{{Pic credgen Logo}}”, “{{Video Blooper 3.mov XXL}}”","Text below or right of the body.

“{{Style …}}” works like in the @Head.","Vertical gap between the head-body-tail blocks above and below (in configured project-wide units, or in pixels when appending “px”).",Starts a new head-body-tail block with this style. The new style is also applied to all following blocks.,"Prevents harmonization of the “Head”, “Body”, or “Tail” across this point. Separate multiple choices by spaces.","For cards: Starts a new spine at this horizontal and optionally vertical offset from the screen center in pixels. Appending “Below” or “Above” puts the new spine below or above the position instead of centering it. Examples: “-400”, “-400 200”, “-400 200 Below”

For scrolls: Starts a new spine beneath the previous one at this horizontal offset from the screen center in pixels. Example: “-400”

For both: You may also enter a horizontal offset from the screen center followed by “Parallel” to put the new spine next to the previous one. Or use “Hook”, which is explained via a warning when you type it. Examples: “-400 Parallel”, “Hook 1 Bottom-Top”, “Hook 1 Top-Top 800”, “Hook 2 Bottom-Middle 800 100”",Starts a new page with this style.,"Desired runtime of the new page as a timecode. Multiple scroll pages can be tweaked together by prepending a group name to the first page’s timecode and using that group name as the runtime of the other pages. Examples for SMPTE: “00:04:56:23”, “XYZ 00:04:56:23”, “XYZ”","Temporal gap between pages as a positive or negative timecode, or “Melt” to insert cards into scroll pages, plus an optional transition duration timecode and style to smoothly change the scrolling speed. Examples for SMPTE: “00:04:56:23”, “-00:04:56:23”, “Melt”, “Melt 00:00:02:00 Linear”"
